# ðŸ“² eSIM #2

{% hint style="info" %}
This method is useful if you want an _**eSIM only**_ option, or if you have an _**eSIM only**_ iPhone!
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
This method is still _**NEW and EXPERIMENTAL**_. There is no guarantee that this will work for you.
{% endhint %}

## Steps:

1. Activate the eSIM on the eSIM-only iPhone **(Please wait about 10-20 minutes to make sure that Apple has your number registered to iMessage.)**
2. Turn on **Airplane Mode**, but keep the **Wi-Fi** on
3. Go to your Android device and proceed to activate the eSIM on the Android device
4. Keep your iPhone always powered on, plugged in and connected to Wi-Fi
5. On your Mac, make sure to accept the "new number" being added to your Apple ID

<summary>What should I do if my number gets deregistered?</summary>

If your number gets deregistered, here are some options:

* Try the [Troubleshooting options](../../overview/troubleshooting.md) and try the method again
* Switch back to a physical SIM card and use your active and inactive SIM with the [Physical SIM methods](./#physical-sim-methods)
