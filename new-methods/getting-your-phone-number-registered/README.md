# ⛓️ Getting your Phone Number Registered

{% hint style="info" %}
Finding the best method to work for you and your carrier is vital in the process of getting your phone number registered to iMessage. Each method will indicate which carrier it works well with.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
There is no guarantee that each method will work with your carrier. It also depends on the SIM cards that are being used. Each carrier is different with how their SIM cards work. If you have any problems, or find an issue, please let me know right away.
