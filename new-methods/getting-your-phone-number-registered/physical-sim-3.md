# üì∂ Physical SIM #3

{% hint style="info" %}
This is the modified version of [AirMessage's Method #1](https://airmessage.org/help/guide/phone-number#keeping-inactive-sim), reported to work for AT\&T and Cricket users, may or may not work for other carriers.

* [Here's the original Reddit post for the modified Method #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirMessage/comments/fx9qku/working\_modified\_method\_1/?utm\_source=share\&utm\_medium=web3x\&utm\_name=web3xcss\&utm\_term=1\&utm\_content=share\_button)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Not sure if it works for other carriers such as Verizon, Redpocket or XFinity.

Please let me know if it does!
{% endhint %}

## Steps:

1. Take out any SIM cards that are in your iPhone and disable **iMessage**
2. Take your inactive SIM and put it into your iPhone
3. Edit the **Phone Number** to be your main phone number with the plus and save it
4. Take out the inactive SIM card and replace it with the active SIM card and make sure it still matches your phone number
5. Enable iMessage and wait for the activation (may take a few minutes)
6. If a message pops up saying "Use your Apple ID for iMessage", go ahead and continue to sign in
7. On your Mac, make sure to accept the "new number" being added to your Apple ID
8. Turn on **Airplane Mode**
9. Turn your iPhone off and wait for a few seconds
10. Take out your active SIM and replace it with the inactive SIM
11. Power your iPhone back on and turn on **Wi-Fi**
    * Your number will be connected and work anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours, this is normal. Keep **Airplane Mode** and **Wi-Fi** on.
12. Let your number de-register from iMessage by itself
13. When your number has been de-registered, go to **Settings ‚Üí Messages ‚Üí Send and Receive**. Your number should be grayed out and have a spinning loading symbol next to it. Keep the iPhone on this screen.
    * The OP kept their iPhone on that screen with the loading overnight. It may be different for everyone.
14. After leaving the iPhone on that screen for a uncertain amount of time, your number will now be able to be selected to use for iMessage.
15. You should now be able to use iMessage with your phone number without needing to turn off **Airplane Mode** or putting your active SIM back in.
