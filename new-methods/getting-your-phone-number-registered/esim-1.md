# ðŸ“² eSIM #1

{% hint style="info" %}
This is the main eSIM method. It's the same as the [Physical SIM #1](physical-sim-1.md), but with a small change!
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
This method is still _**NEW and EXPERIMENTAL**_. There is no guarantee that this will work for you.
{% endhint %}

## Steps:

1. Take your active SIM card and put it into your iPhone **(Please wait about 10-20 minutes to make sure that Apple has your number registered to iMessage.)**
2. Turn on **Airplane Mode**, but keep the **Wi-Fi** on
3. Go to your Carrier, or your Carrier's app (**EXAMPLE:** Google Fi, Visible), and enable the eSIM on your Android device
   * _This will deactivate your physical SIM card_
4. Keep your iPhone always powered on, plugged in and connected to Wi-Fi
   * _Keeping the iPhone always on may not be necessary, I'm currently testing it and I haven't been deregistered yet!_
5. On your Mac, make sure to accept the "**new number**" being added to your Apple ID

<summary>What should I do if my number gets deregistered?</summary>

If your number gets deregistered, here are some options:

* Try out the experimental [eSIM only method](esim-2.md)
* Switch back to a physical SIM card and use your active and inactive SIM with the [Physical SIM methods](./#physical-sim-methods)
