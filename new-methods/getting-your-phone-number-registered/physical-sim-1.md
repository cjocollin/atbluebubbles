# ðŸ“¶ Physical SIM #1

{% hint style="info" %}
This is the main method. It _**should**_ work for most carriers; T-Mobile, Boost, Google Fi, etc.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
This _**DOES NOT**_ work with Verizon, AT\&T or Redpocket as users have reported.
{% endhint %}

## Steps:

1. Take your active SIM card and put it into your iPhone **(Please wait about 10-20 minutes to make sure that Apple has your number registered to iMessage.)**
2. Turn on **Airplane Mode**, but keep the **Wi-Fi** on
3. Take out the active SIM card and replace it with the inactive SIM card
4. Keep your iPhone always powered on, plugged in and connected to Wi-Fi
   * _Keeping the iPhone always on may not be necessary, I'm currently testing it and I haven't been deregistered yet!_
5. On your Mac, make sure to accept the "**new number**" being added to your Apple ID
