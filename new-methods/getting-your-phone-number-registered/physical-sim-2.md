# ðŸ“¶ Physical SIM #2

{% hint style="info" %}
This is the second most reliable method. It _**should**_ work for most carriers; T-Mobile, Boost, Google Fi, AT\&T, etc.
{% endhint %}

## Steps:

1. Take your inactive SIM card and put it into your iPhone
2. Edit the **Phone Number** to be your main phone number without the plus
   * Instead of +1 1234567890, enter 1 1234567890
3. Take out your inactive SIM and put in your active SIM into the iPhone **(Please wait about 10-20 minutes to make sure that Apple has your number registered to iMessage.)**
4. Turn on **Airplane Mode**, but keep the **Wi-Fi** off
5. Take out the active SIM card and replace it with the inactive SIM card with the edited **Phone Number**
6. Turn off **Airplane Mode**, but turn **Wi-Fi** on
7. Keep your iPhone always powered on, plugged in and connected to Wi-Fi
   * _Keeping the iPhone always on may not be necessary, I'm currently testing it and I haven't been deregistered yet!_
8. On your Mac, make sure to accept the "**new number**" being added to your Apple ID
