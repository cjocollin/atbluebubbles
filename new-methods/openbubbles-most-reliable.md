# ðŸ’­ OpenBubbles (Most Reliable)

{% hint style="warning" %}
While using the Beepserv, it is recommended that you use a spare Apple ID.

* Apple has been cracking down on _\[their own]_ users for using Beeper/Beeper Mini. It even caused Beeper to remove iMessage **completely** from their platform.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**OpenBubbles is a fork of the popular app, BlueBubbles! It offers in-app iMessage registration with the help of a Mac or a Relay server on an iPhone!**

It also supports emoji reactions, text styles, effects, Facetime, FindMy, Photo Album sharing, etc!

This is the safest method I've seen and have been using and I know others would enjoy this as much as I do!

## Troubleshooting Options

{% hint style="info" %}
These troubleshooting options came from the [Beepserv Installer GitHub](https://github.com/alfiecg24/beepserv-installer) page.
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Why am I stuck at "Exploiting kernel"?</summary>

This is a common issue with the kfd exploit. Simply reboot your device and try again.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why can I not open/see TrollStore after a successful installation?</summary>

During installation, you will have installed a persistence helper. Open your persistence helper and press "refresh app registrations" to fix TrollStore not being able to be opened.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why am I getting an error about not being able to patchfind?</summary>

Either:

* You're on a non-MacDirtyCow supported version, and are not connected to the internet, or;
* You're using a Yellow iPhone 14 or Yellow iPhone 14 Plus on iOS 16.3 (20D50), in which case, [open a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/alfiecg24/beepserv-installer/issues/new/choose).

Additionally, if a file exists at `/beepserv-installer.app/kernelcache`, the installer will use that file instead of downloading the kernelcache. This can be useful if you have a slow or unreliable internet connection, or happen to have a device and version combination that has no public kernelcache available.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why does the installer say "failed to install persistence helper" using the indirect method?</summary>

The indirect method is not perfect, and sometimes it will fail to install the persistence helper. If this happens, simply shut down your device, turn it back on, and try again. If you repeatedly have issues with the same app, try using a different app.
