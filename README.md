> Activated it on an iPhone X. Did all the waiting steps you mentioned then activated my eSim on my Pixel 7 Pro.
>
> So far, I've been connected for 2 days. BlueBubbles (private API) has also been running flawlessly.
>
> I've set my Mac, iPhone, and iPad to only send and receive iMessages from my phone number. I don't want to text people accidentally via my email.

> Solid post! I've been messaging myself once or twice a day just to check, I'm still up as of this morning.
>
> For my Datapoint: My main active sim is Boost (on AT\&T) and my dummy sim was a never-activated H2O (also on AT\&T) sim card. So while they're both MVNOs, they are essentially two AT\&T sims.
>
> And I never tried OP's method without resetting the phone, so it very well might not be necessary at all. But after repeatedly failing every iteration of Airmessage method #1 and 6 I could think of, and since the iPhone was rooted and had some Beeper taint on it, I wanted a fresh start. .

> Hi, just wanted to add a quick point as I remember commenting on [u/DoctorBONG](https://www.reddit.com/user/DoctorBONG/) 's post regarding the iPhone in the basement! I actually haven't had issues leaving my iPhone in my office without airplane mode at all, just keep it powered and on wifi which powers my apple watch notifs!! Maybe more testing to confirm if the basement part really is necessary, but I've had this method running for the last year now and so far so good, beeper mini is the only thing that gave me trouble ðŸ˜…! Thx for making this a larger post though, can confirm it's worked for me even if the iPhone dies for a day or two!

> I got mine working back in December by activating an eSim on old iPhone proceeding to sign in and set up iMessage. Then turned on airplane mode and chatted with customer service to activate physical sim in my Android. eSim has been going strong for over a month now iPhone needs charging about once a week.
