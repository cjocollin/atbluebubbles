# ⁉️ FAQ

<details>

<summary>Will this work with different carrier SIM cards?</summary>

This needs to be tested more, but users have reported that it does not. So it's recommended to use the same carrier or MVNOS on the same network for now.

* **EXAMPLE:** Boost = AT\&T

<details>

<summary>How long will my number stay registered?</summary>

That's a good question, will update more on this later, but this method has been super reliable for me so far **(\~2 months in)**.

<details>

<summary>Do I need to turn off my iPhone or change the phone number in my Settings at all during this process?</summary>

No! Not like the other methods, huh? I didn't have to turn off the phone or change anything in the settings at all during this process, making it so easy!

* This does not include the methods that require you to change your number in your settings. This only implies to the first Physical SIM method and eSIM methods.

<details>

<summary>Which method would be best for me?</summary>

It all depends on what carrier you're using and what your SIM preference would be. If you're already using an eSIM, I would use the eSIM methods.

<summary>Does my phone need to stay on 24/7?</summary>

I'm still testing this, but as of now, it doesn't seem necessary, but I personally think it's still recommended.&#x20;

When I first did the method, I kept mine on 24/7 because I always had no luck after turning off my iPhone, my number would always deregister from iMessage, but it never did that with this method **(\~3 months in, even with the iPhone off).**
